# CLIP Image-Text Matching

This project implements a custom version of the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model, which is a text-image embedding model. The model is trained on the Flickr30k dataset to learn the relationship between images and their corresponding captions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Timm
- Albumentations
- Pandas
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```
!pip install -q Kaggle timm transformers
```

## Dataset

The code uses the Flickr30k dataset, which can be downloaded from the Kaggle website. The dataset is extracted and the captions are preprocessed and saved to a CSV file.

## Model Architecture

The CLIP model consists of the following components:

1. **ImageEncoder**: A pre-trained image classification model (e.g., ResNet152) that encodes the input images into a fixed-size feature vector.
2. **TextEncoder**: A pre-trained DistilBERT model that encodes the input captions into a fixed-size feature vector.
3. **ProjectionHead**: A fully connected layer that projects the image and text embeddings into a shared latent space.

The model is trained to minimize the contrastive loss between the image and text embeddings, encouraging the model to learn a joint representation of images and their corresponding captions.

## Training and Evaluation

The code provides functions for training and evaluating the CLIP model. The `main()` function is the entry point, which performs the following steps:

1. Splits the dataset into train and validation sets.
2. Initializes the CLIP model and the optimizer.
3. Trains the model for the specified number of epochs, saving the best model based on the validation loss.

The `find_matches()` function is used to find the top `n` images that are most similar to a given query text. It computes the dot product between the text embedding and the image embeddings, and selects the top-matching images.

## Usage

To run the code, you can execute the `main()` function. The code will automatically download the Flickr30k dataset, preprocess the data, and train the CLIP model. After training, you can use the `find_matches()` function to find the most similar images for a given query text.

```python
main()
find_matches(model, image_embeddings, "man playing guitar", valid_df['image'].values, n=25)
```

## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by the original CLIP paper and implementation. The code is adapted from various sources and may require further optimization and refinement.
